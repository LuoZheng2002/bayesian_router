different layers have different obstacles
A* start can be in one or multiple layers (push nodes of different layers to frontier)
A* end can be in one or multiple layers

vias cannot collide with pads even if they are of the same net
but vias and pads of the same net do not need to consider clearance

When to go to a new layer:
collides with an obstacle, and then it will back up and try to drill to different layers
push all to the frontier at the same time to avoid adding tags to the nodes
